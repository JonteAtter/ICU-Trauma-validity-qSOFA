# Project 20 weeks 
Most projects that I supervise run for 20 weeks, which is equivalent
to one semester in Swedish universities. I recommend that you put in a
lot of work during the first 10 weeks, and even more so during the
initial four weeks, to make sure that you meet project deadlines and
achieve the desired learning outcomes. The timeline here is a
suggestion that I've found to work well for most projects.
