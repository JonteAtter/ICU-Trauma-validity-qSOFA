Introduction
============


__TRAUMA IS A GLOBAL PROBLEM AND MORE SO IN LOW INCOME REGION:__ Globaly about 13 % of all Disease Adjusted Life Years(DALY) lost can be atributaded to injuries as of 2017 <!--(Global, regional, and national disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 359 diseases and injuries and healthy life expectancy (HALE) for 195 countries and territories, 1990–2017: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017, the lancet)--> And about 8% of deaths globaly, or about 4.5 million deaths, was a cause of injuries in 2017 <!-- https://www.thelancet.com/lancet/visualisations/gbd-compare --> The injuries can often lead to extensive medical treatment and sometime admission to the ICU. In a paper publiced 2012 Charles mock et al calculated that in 2010 90% of all deaths due to trauma and injuries was in low and middle income cuntries with much higher mortality rates compared to high income countries and that an imporvment in trauma care globally to that level of high income countries could save between 1.7 and 2 million lives annually. <!-- (An Estimate of the Number of Lives that Could be Saved through Improvements in Trauma Care Globally, World jurnal of surgery 2012) -->

__What is SOFA and qSOFA:__ One of the complications of severe injuries is a state called sepsis and septic shock. The main causes for septic shock is infection and non communicable diseases but around 4 percent is caused by injuries. <!-- Global, regional, and national sepsis incidence and mortality, 1990–2017: analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study, the lancet -->  As by the third consensus definition of Sepsis and septic shock states that Sepsis is a SOFA score of 2 points or more and Septic shock a subset of sepsis where the patient is in need of vasopressor treatment of have a serum lactate level over 2mmol/L after adequate fluid treatment. In settings where laboratory analysises can not be performed rappidly qSOFA has been developed constituting of three parts: respiratory rate of 22/min or greater, reduced GCS or systolic BP of 100 mmHg and less. And a score of above 2 can be correlated with a more severe case and lower survival.  <!--The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3), JAMA 2016 --> <!-- Developing a New Definition and Assessing New Clinical Criteria for Septic Shock, JAMA 2016 --> <!-- Assessment of Clinical Criteria for Sepsis, JAMA 2016 -->

__WHAT IS THE REASON FOR WRITING THIS AND THE SCOPE OF THE ARTICLE__ The, SOFA, qSOFA score has been studied and evaluated before and after the Sepsis-3 consensus definition. But it has not yet been sufficiently studied if qSOFA is a good predictor of admission to the ICU of trauma patients in hospitals in a low reasorce setting. In that case qSOFA could be used to direct the resourses and care to the most critically ill patients and thus save lifes in low income cuntries. <!--Källor?? samma som ovan?-->

__något mer som bör tas upp i indroduction?__

<!--*The background/introduction should summarise the scope of the problem,
what is known about the problem, what is not known, what specific
knowledge gap the study is supposed to fill and why this is
important. It should end be stating the aim of the study. The
background should be 4-5 paragraphs long and each paragraph should be
between 3-5 sentences. Strive to make the paragraphs about the same
length.* -->

Methods
=======
__Känns som jag mest kopierar det som du skrev i PPFen i våras helt ärligt. Och sen är det en del statistiska termer och index jag inte hört om, ska google men kanske kommer behöva lite förtydliganden på torsdag... Och en del av Tripodkriterierna vet jag faktiskt inte då jag inte vet så mycket om hur databasen kom till eller ser ut vad gäller inklussion etc.__

A retrospective cohort study of 16 000 trauma patients admitted to four university hospitals in urban India between 2013 and 2015 that seeks to study the predictive value of qSOFA on the primary outcome of ICU admissions. 

Från PPF "This will be a retrospective analysis of a cohort of trauma patients admitted to four public university hospitals in urban India between 2013 and 2015. The complete cohort includes 16 000 patients. The primary outcome will be ICU admission. The predictors included in qSOFA are respiratory rate, Glasgow coma scale, and systolic blood pressure. Validity will be assessed in terms of predictive performance, which in turn will be measures as discrimination an calibration. Calibration will further be visualised using calibration plots. An optimal cutoff will be identified using the Youden index and sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, positive and negative predictive values will assessed at this cutoff. The original model will finally be compared to a updated model, using the same predictive performance measures. Updating will be performed using logistic regression. Bootstrapping will be used to estimate 95% confidence intervals associated with point estimates. Missing data will be handled using multiple imputation. "
